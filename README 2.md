The Adult income dataset which is prpvidfe by UC Irvine Machine learning Respository is one our group is going to choose for our group project. The reason for our group to choose this tpoic is because adult income is very important for people, it is what family care about. Also, It could shows many problems in the World Economy like the gap between rich and poor has always been a hot debatable topic nowadays. We are going to use the dataset to explore the adult income difference from different ages, different job areas, gender, relationship, native country, education backgroud, working hours etc. I can imagine use this datasets to make a data dashboard because using it makes us to collect all the datasets together into a graph will make people more easy to analyse the data sets and see the problems between different graphs. We want to explore which factors listed has become the major effect to the adult income. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset we chose is called Adult Dataset is being provided by UC Irvine Machine Leaning Repository. The multivariate dataset contains census data that is used to predict if an individual makes over $50K a year. It has 48842 instances and 14 attributes.x The data for this dataset was collected by Barry Becker in 1994 who then donated it to UCI in 1996.It was collected for classification and research purposes, and to determine whether a person makes more than $50,000 a year. As of now the dataset has 1959402 web hits. While it is not clear how exactly Barry Becker collected the data but a set of reasonably clean records was extracted using the following conditions: ((AAGE>16) && (AGI>100) && (AFNLWGT>1)&& (HRSWK>0)). The dataset contains general information about the individuals like- age, occupation, relationship, native country etc. The dataset has been used by over fifty researchers across the world.
