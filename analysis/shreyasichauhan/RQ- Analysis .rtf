\f0\fs36 \cf0 In my research I was looking at the relationship between an individual\'92s race and salary. It is very interesting how the distribution is pretty similar in both the cases, that is about 85 percent of the population move and below 50k salary is White. What makes this more interesting is that about 2/3 of the world population is from Asia. A great second step to this research would be comparing this dataset to a world population dataset and somewhat salaries of these individuals. For example, >=50K includes anything between 50k to a 100k so it is not a very precise depiction. I was hoping to see a trend between the average salaries of people from different countries and races from the point of view of how the currencies are different. Like, someone from India would have a lower average salary than someone from Paris since there is a huge difference in the currency. However, besides that I also found out that on average most of the jobs are taken by white people. }
