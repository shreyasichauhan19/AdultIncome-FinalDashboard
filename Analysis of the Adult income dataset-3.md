# Analysis of the Adult income dataset
*Introduction*
From the first milestone, our group decide to choose the **adult income dataset** which is prpvide by >UC Irvine Machine learning Respository.Our goal is to analysis this datset and find out the raltionship between eduction level and the income level. At the beginning of this project, our data set was based on adult income with over 10 thousand data. However, this data set only shows whether the income was over 50 thousand or not. So, I would like to start at my stereotype that most people have higher salary because they have higher education. Base on that I choose education year and income as two parameters. And the result is true because most of the people who have higher salary would have higher income. It is really useful to use markdown during the programming. It helps not only programmer but also reader to understand what this program are doing. To be frank, the result was not really interesting because we know that people pay their time on study and they learn more then they deserve a high income. The data stands for this stereotype at all. However, there are some limits during the work. Firstly, income was not a number and it is hard to visulize as a range. Therefore, the visualization was based on the histogram. And also, this data set was collected on 1996, which was a outdate data set. It may not helps people to analysis the adult income right now. THis data set can only proved that poeple who lived in 1996 in America, more education years means higher probability to get higher income.

*Analysis*
I have use the pie graph to show the relationship between the education level and the income level. From the graph 1, we can cleary see that when the income is below 50K, the largest distribution group is that the high school graduate student which was about 35.7%. And the second largesr amount of the group is college students which is about 23.9% after that was the bachelor students which is 12.7%. From that we can see the basic group of the education level seemed to be the High school that in other words if you are high school graduates students you can get below 50K per year as a job. From the graph 2, we can see if you want to get the income which is above 50K per year; you should get the bachelor degree which is 28.3% nearly 1/3 in the population. However the high school graduate seemed to be the second largest group among the distribution graph which is 21.4%. From that, we can conculde the higher the income you should have the higher degree which is at least high school graduates.
